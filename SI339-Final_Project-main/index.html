            Helllo, my name is Faith Yun. I am a current studying at the University of Michigan studying User Experience under the School of Information. For my accessibility and web development class, I have decided to take on a personal project to showcase what I have learned and challenge myself through this website. This webiste is a compilation of memories I have over the years and a little bit more about me personally. I hope you get to know a bit more about me! Thank you!
